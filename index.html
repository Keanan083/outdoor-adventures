        <p class="intro">
            Most of us these days live a fast-paced, technology-packed lifestyle. Between work, the commute, taking care of the kids, cooking and cleaning, watching television, connecting on social media, and more, we’re spending an average of 90 percent of our time indoors.
        <br>
            That would have been nearly unheard of a mere 50 years ago.
        <br>
            Unfortunately, all this indoor time is having a negative impact on our health—and on our children’s health.
        <br>
            It’s time we unplugged and stepped outside.

                        <p>The city of Cape Town and its suburbs surround the giant 80km long mountain chain stretching from Signal Hill above Table Bay to Cape Point in the South. In Cape Town life literally centres around the mountain.</p>

                        <p>Hunting in the Western Cape is an experience unlike any other! We are extremely proud of our world class hunting area near Cape Town, in the Western Cape - the province is one of the country's most beautiful. The Western Cape is topographically and climatically varied. It has a temperate southern coastline fringed with mountains. The typical vegetation, especially in the western section, is the famed fynbos. To the north it stretches deep into the Karoo plateau.</p>
