        <p class="intro">
            Most of us these days live a fast-paced, technology-packed lifestyle. Between work, the commute, taking care of the kids, cooking and cleaning, watching television, connecting on social media, and more, we’re spending an average of 90 percent of our time indoors.
        <br>
            That would have been nearly unheard of a mere 50 years ago.
        <br>
            Unfortunately, all this indoor time is having a negative impact on our health—and on our children’s health.
        <br>
            It’s time we unplugged and stepped outside.
